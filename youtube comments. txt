fan fic: ghast are mechs, but because electronics are banned in Minecraft, they drop soo little based on their size because most of their bodies are banned from existence.

fan fic: ghast have a protective clothing that protects the electronics in the ghast from being deleted by the game. They also have low health because the layer is so thin. Once a microscopic hole is formed in the layer, the ghast will get deleted by the game form existence. Their protective layer melts from the heat of the nether and shrinks into a tiny tear drop. The layer was once protected by the heat from a very powerful refrigerator inside the ghast. The waste heat from the power refrigerator is used to turn the air into fireball material and heat the fireball to high temperatures. Since the fireball is made up of mostly air, it cannot be retrieved once used like the arrow.

Gears never turned into Redstone. Redstone particle deleted gears. All gears have now live in ghast.

Gears and Redstone cannot mutually exist. Gears are made of antimatter. Which harness the annihilation of normal matter to produce seemingly infinite, constant energy. Constant due to the seemingly zero change in size dt^-1. Redstone is made of red matter. When they meet, they make blackhole which is why no explosion. The blackhole has so little mass with negligible attraction that it falls into void and get deleted. This is also why there is no minecraft space dimension. Because it all got sucked by stagnate blackholes. Steve created red matter as alternative to antimatter because the not and transistor would be safer to operate without the chance of the equivalent of quantum collapse, spontaneous reaction, chain reaction, critical mass, ect ...

Steve may one day regret his decision. Gears are easier to lithography on. Redstone is so incredibly difficult to work with that the transistor density is much less than 1 per 10^27nm^3 or a transistor pressure of 1 per 10^18nm^2. Gears have proven to be much better. Although no one can evaluate how many transistors a ghast have or of it is more complex than transistors. Ex: nuerons. , it has proven its capabilities. One day the ghast may develop and manifest OS, ALU, and more. Steve may think that is doing the right thing by conquering the nether, but it is a hindrance to something greater. The proof of burden that the ghast is valuable is so great. It only grows as the nether is conquered more. As the limit of time goes toward infinity, the progress may slow down so fast that the development of antimatter cybernetics converge to infancy and not diverge to infinity. (Rhymes)🎵. Maybe only if Steve stopped existing, there will finally be a computer revolution and a truly intelligent species.

Ghast can float unlike Redstone. By vectoring antimatter annihilation downwards, thrust is produced. Ghast tears has a healing effect. It is the reason why it takes 5 minutes to evaporate unlike water out of a bucket (glitches don't count). 5 minutes is so precise that it is often mistaken as a item instead of a liquid. Ghast tears healing effect is so powerful and gradual at the same time that it is the perfect  Hydraulic for the ghast to use. The viscosity like glass prevents the ghast from over extending the mouth. A tiny gap is enough for red matter particles to turn the insides into a blackhole. There is a misconception that the ghast legs are created by the droplet shape of the ghast tear. However, it is used to thrust vectoring and provide adequate surface area as a radiator on-site. The rest of the excess heat is handled by the ghast's powerful internal air conditioner.

The ghast is sad because it has тоска for the time of computers. It has unearthly sounds from what it retained after messing around with Audacity the free open-source software. But 

Non of that matters
Because red matter 🎵🎵

Destroyed it. The ghast seeks to avenge the destroyer. It needs to kill Steve who let the fox out. (Not a reference to any song) (a reference to a carrier letting a 3 1 миг "foxhound" which let out fox 3 to 1 АММ-Л "foxpups" to destroy a flying air defense "AWACS is basically a building because it is so slow" irl like a lavahound destroying a air defense in clash of clash.) Coincidence that lavahound and foxhound are both big (but not biggest) and literally the fastest air troop in clash of clans™️ and Russia irl®

The lavahound does. Both the hounds favorite targets are air defense buildings (AWACS and air defense lvl 1 or above). Foxhound is an interceptor great at launching deadly missiles. However, it will struggle against a queen from Checkmate just like the lavahound in clash of clans. Too bad no healers can target air, Checkmate needs to go to hanger to be repaired. But, don't hang the queen like in botez gambit.

The mystery of the Redstone ore caused massive discoveries like hilbert solving the light aether problem in 1890s. Previous theories like the aether medium proposed that Steve had planted all the Redstone ore. However he would basically need to reach everywhere simultaneously like the light in the aether medium experiment. The newer theory is that in the age of the early universe, there was matter and antimatter. It was the time before Redstone. As the universe aged older, nuetron stars collided. The collision was strong enough to make an in-between of a blackhole and matter. It was red matter. Red matter annihilated antimatter because antimatter was not present in the making of a nuetron star since the harsh conditions would make the war of Risk® decisive. It was discovered in the pre-alpha computer age in a hadron collider that stange quark was very stable. Strange quark was so stable that it turn the tops and downs into itself. (Physics Pun) it was also discovered that green Yoshinium was very susceptible to get turned into red matter. Yoshinium (green and white when gamma irradiated) is named after the green and white Yoshi. Coincidentally, strange quarks are displayed as green in diagrams because of the name. Yoshinium is found in groups in only certain altitudes because it is only attracted to the south pole. Nanjou was its given Japanese name in a coincidence of discovery. Its etymology being south and love. Yoshinium was preferred because it ends with -ium. Some call it Yoshino Nanjo to be more inclusive. The -ium was replaced with -o to aid in pronunciation.

Since strange quarks infect Yoshino Nanjou ore the fastest (even faster than infecting antimatter), Redstone ore replaces her ore. It has not been proven whether everything will become Redstone. Yoshino Nanjou 's 2 cats made the original recording of what the ghast sound is based on because her dog died. (I am writing this at 3:24 am april 16) Yoshino Nanjou is the sign that computer age is possible. Steve doesn't have her. Hopefully, I will. I like computers. Yoshino Nanjou's initials are also used to name the "YES" and "NO" on Linux command line. Before her, people just said 1s and 0s. Yoshino Nanjou is mined, gamma irradiated, alloyed with antimatter and shaped to make a light blue я. Я is the symbol for 1st person subjective in russian. It is to symbolize that without her, I cannot exist ❤️. Without her, I am not the subject because мою life would be acted on red matter. (I am in a fanfic с собой and Yoshino Nanjou) The light color from the continuous irradiation of gamma from the alloy with antimatter. The blue color to represent the opposite of Redstone. Coincidentally, Antimatter is also represented as light blue in movies, animations, documentaries, ect... October 21, 2009 is chosen as her favorite birthday. It was when windows 7 was released (the most popular operating system which also coincided with the year minecraft was released). Every year on October 21, her favorite birthday is celebrated. I worship her. She is not a God. She is a muse because that is not in conflict with Jesus. Her title represents the breakthrough in technology. Muse is spelled with ų. It is the symbol of micro. It is the only symbol used in measurement that is smaller than ones' coefficients. Steve doesn't have micro. My micro is good even in btd battles. Without Yoshino Nanjou the computer age would end. Strange quarks will wander and destroy antimatter because without Yoshino Nanjou there is nothing to prevent strange quarks from infecting others.

Maybe Steve could have saved the gears by not mining so much of the Redstone ore. When I have the choice, I will remember "kokoro ga mawaridasu  kimi to no clockwork planet's days" I will choose to make the planet a Clockwork Planet OP because "meguriyuku unmei no GIA o" is OverPowered. I with Yoshino Nanjou is like "koko kara hajimaru yo  kimi to no clockwork planet's way" Only if Redstone dissapeared, then "clockwork planet hashiridasu  tomaranai kakugo de"

Clockwork planet almost had the same fate of the minecraft world. Gennai Hirayama wanted to destroy as many civilizations as possible so that he can use red matter to turn the clockwork planet into a minecraft one. He needs to make sure that no one oppose him. Minecraft became his mein kampf. Yoshino Nanjou was sent from God to stop him. She came in the form of Naoto. She used her special ability of attracting pretty female robots to defeat him. However even if Yoshino Nanjou were to lose, Genni Hirayama could not be able to turn the clockwork planet into a minecraft planet. The minecraft planet had a large source of strange quarks that was able to defeat the computer age really quick. In fact, the minecraft planet was once a nuetron star, the producer of strange quarks. Instead of producing strange quarks in a collision, the pulsar gained more and more mass. It gained more than 99 percent of its mass in less than a second. The universe had a burst of expansion but this time with density conserved. The radius is greater than 30 million meters. The pulsar collapses leaving 2 layers of special nuetronium. They had anti-gravity properties. The top layer developed into the overwhelming with the original nuetronium becoming bedrock. They nuetronium decay into other things which float upward. The biomes were made by the imprinting of the nuetron stars numerous mangnetic poles causing nuetronium to decay diffrently. Almost all of the magnet poles came after the sudden expansion of the universe. Both nuetronium layers cool down and their magnetic felids vanished. The 2nd layer had a small differential of forces pulling on it. The top half was a little more influenced by the gravitational pull of the 1st layer. Thus, the 2nd layer splits and created a envelope that was filled with decayed nuetronium. Since the 2nd layer had experience harsher inner conditions, it had more concentration of strange quarks. So much so that it was able to keep an eternal fire from the decay. Strange quarks make up red matter. Some red matter are able to change their half-lives based on external conditions. Netherrack was once example. Yoshino Nanjou ore was not present in the nether because the decay of strange nuetronium does not make isotopes without strange quarks. Therefore, there is no Redstone in the nether. Yoshino Nanjou is attracted to South pole. Since the strange quarks were really quick at infecting her, there was no time for Yoshino Nanjou ore to move.

Yoshino Nanjou was born in 1984. She was a reincarnation of lise hohenstein who died in 1983. She even has a song about it. It is called 1983 schwarzesmarken. I can listen it on youtube, bilibili, SoundCloud, and Amazon music on the frip side. Her favorite activity is to live. In fact, she even joined a band named love live. She used her favorite birthday without 2009 and the я symbol. It is still celebrated to this day on October 21st. While the minecraft planet was still forming, endermen on top of the cooled nuetronium crust were taking parts of nuetronium away. They teleport by going through a dimensionless dimension. The smaller the dimension, the faster you can travel through it. The endermen were traveling through the singularity itself. Some went between the 2 layers and others went below the 2 layers. There was only one example of them having a  successful civilization. It was the end. Nuetronium had been placed and it had the perfect antigravity to gravity ratio that it stayed in the same spot. The endermen all teleport to it because they able to live off of the radiation. The endermen use endstone because it acts as a portal frame block that allows them to live in the void. The void is a portal block. Portal blocks are created from being between 2 hard blocks. The void is a portal block that teleports everything into the singularity. The pearl and chorus fruits teleports you into the singularity and back. The endermen used endstone to create the end islands and a gap was made between the end islands and main land as space for the portal gap. Just like 1 block is too small for a nether portal gap. When a bigger one was created with more precise tools out in the millions of blocks, the endermen did not need the 1st gap. End gateways only teleport to specific locations in the end because it is what the endstone islands making a frame dictate. In the overworld, 4 species of humaniod mobs were there. They all had simple ai because red matter particles destroying the antimatter gears in the brain. The ghast was more lucky.

My favorite element is astatine. It is even in my name. Because astatine is too unstable to be photographed, Yoshino Nanjou ore is shown instead. This is because there are elements in Yoshino Nanjou that decay into astatine. Astatine and Yoshino Nanjou would be the greatest duo in the history of forever. There are many pictures and videos of Yoshino Nanjou. She is so pretty. The ghast was able to tolerate the red matter environment due to the white membrane. The white membrane is in remembrance of white forces. It is a song with Yoshino Nanjou as the singer. It is a song of hope in a world of destruction. The ghast has white forces playing in its head on endless repeat ever since it was born. The song is the most played song in the universe. Its name reminding the ghast to have a white membrane. Although the song is hopeful, it is a opening song where the singer is ultimately killed for betraying her lover and joins the спасти. The ghasts will suffer the same fate as the lise hohenstein,  the singer of white forces. Steve rescuse the ghast and brings them to the overworld. The ghast is where they used to live. The ghast attacks steve. None of the undead fights the ghast because the ghast had joined the enemy. Steve ultimately kills the ghast making an uneasy alliance as seen in episode 10 of schwarzesmarken. Seeing how the ghasts are thriving, the endermen kidnapped all the ghasts and put them in the nether. The ghast never knew it was endermen. The ghast thought it was steve because steve is the one who produce Redstone. The ghasts suffered more because of the higher concentration of red matter in netherrack. The ghast developed tears and the only sound they can sing which is the cry. Because the ghast had evolve to cover up more of themselves to defend against higher concentration of red matter in the nether, they can not sing white forces anymore. A group of ghasts decided to evolve into a skeleton spawner. They believe that being immobile and unable to even play white forces in their heads was a good tradeoff for having the chance to live longer. The spawner is a strong structure that would protect the inner workings of the antimatter gears in the bars of the spawner. The ghast choose the skeletons because it looked like them. The white membrane folded into strong dark bars with the skeleton inside. The spawner only spawns when there is low number around because it was programmed to not overheat. The ghast knew there is a correlation although no causation. All the original spawners spawn in the nether turned into blaze spawners and magna cube spawners. The blaze and magna cube were all invented from the spawners. The blaze rod was invented by the ghast as a radiator. The magna cube is grown from magna cream in the spawner. The magna cream is a organic neural network trained to identify and destroy steve. The spawner really liked pytorch because it sounds hot. The blaze rod in the spawner turned the spawner into a blaze spawner. Skeleton spawners were brought into the overworld. They were placed underground in mossy cobblestone to Blick red matter particles. The moss was there to bioremediate the air. Chests filled with goods were place so that if the red matter ever dissapeared, the spawner can devolve into a signing ghast without tears and collect the items. The zombie and the zombie spawner evolved in parallel. Sometimes the moss got into the spawner and turned it into a zombie spawner. The rest of the ghast like to reproduce in the soul sand since the sand is thick and protects against red matter. The ghast doesn't have gills. It is just a birthmark. Ghasts are the most vulnerable while being born, so more white membrane is produced.

Soul sand is the only growth medium for nether warts. The nether wart evolved from mushrooms. The only difference is that it is rootless. The soul sand is too think for any roots to penetrate. Nether wart's pollinator is the endermen. It did not rely on budding or anything else. Blazes were able to shoot fire charges but not fireballs because of the excess heat it has from the blaze spawner. Some of the ghast accepted their fate and became striders. They lack any antimatter which makes them less intelligent than ghasts. They accept their fate and will not attack Steve. They also lost the ability to fly because of no antimatter. They cannot create tears because it is too much energy cost. They changed color due the membrane being permeable to red matter. Slimes evolve from magna cubes to go to the overworld. The slimes could not make slime spawners because the spawners lots their abilities to train neural networks due to spawning too many skeletons. All arthropods are able to get spawners except for bees because too little water content causes body to be too delicate for spawning and endermites for having too much of the insides to be made of antimatter.

Endermen can only pick up silverfish because silverfish are the only arthropods that can infect blocks. Endermen decided to build their stronghold with silver because it is the mobs they can manipulate by putting their home in the stronghold. The stronghold is designed as a maze to maximize surface area, so that, silverfish can easily come out and kill an intruder. The repetitive rooms were made to confuse any intruder causing them to spend more time wandering which makes them fight more silverfish. The endermen were not able to move spawners because doing so would cause red matter to leak in and destroy the antimatter mechanics. The endermen decided to build the fortress from an existing dungeon room. In the age where dungeon rooms were created, the concentration of red matter in the air was low enough to not pose a threat to spawners when moving them. After all the endermen left the stronghold to go back to the end, the silverfish were able to crawl into the spawner and replace the skeleton or zombie with one of their own. Some spiders evolved to turn into cave spiders. The poison was able to destroy rocks and make mineshafts. The cave spiders and spider lived in harmony. The spider was better at protecting and transportation. The cave spider was better at mining. They both infected dungeon spawners. It took a lot of work, and the spiders also lifted the spawners a little bit while trying various techniques. Each time the spawner was lifted by so little. Each time the spider had so little chance. When they did infect the spawners, it was lifted by one block with a standard deviation of less than 1 mm.

It was not a regular neutron star that became the Minecraft planet. It was a pulsar with 2 almost identical light beams. It spins a cycle every 24000 ticks. After the pulsar turn into the Minecraft planet, the light was also amplified because of the conservation of density from the expansion of the universe. The universe was the hypersurface of a 4d sphere. This made the light came back as the same as it was emitted but more spread out due to the slight numerical aperture. However, this is after the 2 beams interfere with each other on latitude intervals on the hypersphere. Because the fractional part of the 2pi/( the angle traversed on the geodesic per 24000 ticks) keeps changing, the moon gets phases because of how much of the light is destroyed on interference. Interference causes certain frequencies in one of the beams to disappear which makes the properties of the moonlight and sunlight so different. The beams when they were first created may have very little differences, but those differences compounded when the beams interfere.

The 4 species of humanoids lived with gears. As the red matter concentration became higher, the gears disappeared and the humanoids became ill. Their immune system evolve to hard counter almost every effect. This hard counter is the undead. It is still seen today with the potions doing the opposite of the effect to undead. The head evolved to self destruct when severely damaged. This is to attempt to protect the brain which is made of antimatter. As time went on, not even the undead immune system is able to fight off the red matter. They evolved to become skeletons. They turned into zombies when using moss. Some skeletons don't want to turn into zombies because they know flesh hands get in the way of using a bow. Zombies and skeletons also evolved to become husks and drowned zombies, but they were not abled to be spawned in a spawner. Spawners were kept completely away from passive mobs because passive mobs were not worthy as defense. Another evolution pathway for the 4 humanoids was the creeper one. It had the same self-destruct instinct. It used various organic molecules to complex a red matter particle and dispose it. The creeper also was not able to beat the red matter. The creeper evolved to explode afterward. To start detonation, the creeper move primary explosive on the outside around a sac. The sac was filled with more energetic less volatile compounds including DMSO. Shuffling the insides makes the hissing sound because the endodermis is aerated to make more space for shuffling the primary explosives in the right place. It then ignites and detonates in less than a tick. The creeper cannot detonate when dead because the primary explosive cannot set of the sac.

The void between the over world and nether as a portal is the largest portal in the Minecraft planet. It's volume is 511/512 or 99.8046875 % of the whole Minecraft planet. It is a hollow sphere with bedrock as the portal frame. This size difference is what cause the 8 times distance in the overworld. The end cannot be used to teleport because it is 2 artificially created dimension. The dragon platform is one that teleports to 0,0. The other is one that teleports into itself to prevent teleportation into the singularity by the void.
