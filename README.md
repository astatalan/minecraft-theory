could not fit in bio: "The definition of logic is something turns off when others turn on, and something turns on when others turn off, and has the ability to combine nonexclusively." quote created in may 13 2023. 00:19

another qoute. i thought of stuff and it is a continuation of my previous quote. 01:27 may 14 2023. also, celebration of my 3rd anniversary of hearing for the first time of an aqours song. it was koi ni naritai aquarium. i have and still always thought it sounded like dora the explorer song. also, coincindentally the first day that i know about the 2b2t spawn aquarium from fitMC. and mark Zuckerberg 39th birth day. it also would have been my 3rd aniversary of taking an ap exam if my school had not changed their curriculum to teach apush unlike 2019. "The exclusive gate should be the same as a false source. and the exclusive not gate should be the same as the true source. It was the etymology of the xor gate that made me realize the last part of my last quote. without the xor gate, there would not be any justification to name the xand gate. it would have a name that did not sound exclusive. only if and only if gate could have made me otherwise realize that logic is something that needs the ability to combine nonexclusively because of the only sound of exclusiveness. iff dose not have any hint of exclusiveness to me unless I check its etymology. it was by luck that the human language developed like that. And it was by luck that philisophers focused on other evidence of logic that was not the logic gate . i was surprised that out of all the definitions given by my peers in january 2022 in logic and game theory class at msms that none of their definitions matched my definition which at that time stopped before it theorized the ability for logic to combine.. i had shared my definition with the class, but i have not found any trace of it to propogate outside of that class. both x and n are prefixes of and and or. not is n by itself. today i thought that x should stand by itself. so i thought x should either be always true or always false. just like how x as a prefix reduced 2 sources of logic to just one, the x by itself reduced one source of logic to none. furthermore, both x as a prefix and x by itself has a logic table with even numbers of true and false. victory day 2023, i was watching a minecraft video.https://youtu.be/HQTcGzOCN7g . i thought of course you can because logic is when something turns off others turn on and vice versa. but i worry that the or gate can not combine logic because it cannot make the and gate even with the not gate. so i researched and tried to find on the internet if the or gate can create the and gate. because of the stackoverflow detailing how the xor gate could be created, i thought that xor gate was really powerful and can create all the gates. i tried to think of a solution, but i failed and research that i can't. so i tried to find if that xand gate could create all the gates I already know that if a unlogical gate can create another gate then  that gate is also unlogical. I created the solution to the construction of xand gate in my head. it did not seem to make etymological sense that a name if and only if was unlogical. i had suspicion that it was true because both xand and xor was having even numbers of true and false . the x is pronounced as z so it should be z n zn and or nand nor zand zor"may 14 2023 2:09 eorzea sounds like xor.
